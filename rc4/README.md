Pure Rust implementation of the [RC4 stream cipher][1].

[Documentation][docs-link]

## ðŸš¨ Warning: Cryptographically Broken ðŸš¨

RC4 is [cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use][2]!

[RFC7465][3] and [RFC8758][4] prohibit the use of RC4 in TLS and SSH protocols
respectively, noting that cryptographic weaknesses in the cipher's design make
it practical to recover repeatedly encrypted plaintexts.

This crate is provided for the purposes of legacy interoperability with
protocols and systems which continue to mandate the use of RC4. It should not be
relied on for security/confidentiality.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

## Minimum Supported Rust Version
